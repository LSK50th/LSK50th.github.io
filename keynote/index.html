        Much work in formal semantics assumes truth and rational inference as central ideals, while pragmatics often assumes cooperative information exchange. Yet political speech rarely fits these ideals, frequently sacrificing truth, while reserving cooperation for partisan ends. The key concepts for political language are not truth and cooperativity, but emotional impact, cultural resonance, and power to shift group affiliation. How then do such political, sociological and psychological considerations bear on linguistic theory? I will introduce key features of my recent book with Jason Stanley, The Politics of Language, which is motivated not by the ideals of cooperative information exchange, but by the messy, non-ideal world of social and political interaction. After introducing the framework, I turn to a paradigm case of non-ideal language: slurs. In both Korean and English, slurs carve up the social world along regional, ethnic, class, and gender boundaries, reproducing hierarchies of power. I argue that such language cannot be understood within standard idealizations, and that only a theory grounded in social reality can explain their peculiar power to wound and to divide.

He has courtesy appointments to Philosophy and to the Human Dimensions of Organization (HDO) program, also serving as director of the Cognitive Science Program. He currently serves as the Linguistics department graduate advisor, and has previously served as the graduate advisor for HDO.

        Beaver‚Äôs research centers on the nature of meaning, taking formal semantics and pragmatics as a start point to approach questions with many different flavors, computational, philosophical, political, psychological, and sociological. His recent work includes the co-development in The Politics of Language, computational studies of differences between in-group and out-group language (with his student Venkat Govindarajan and others), work on the semantics of descriptions (with Liz Coppock), and work on the historical development of the mirative intensifier ‚Äúvery‚Äù (with Ashwini Deo). Earlier work includes the books Presupposition and Assertion in Dynamic Semantics, and Sense and Sensitivity (with Brady Clark). These together with two co-edited books, and many journal articles and book chapters, have garnered over 10,000 citations (Google Scholar). Beaver is a fellow of the Linguistics Society of America, and was founding editor with Kai von Fintel of the leading journal Semantics and Pragmatics, the first major open access journal in Linguistics.
